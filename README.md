# Louder Whispers

A module for Foundry VTT which will help you pay a-goddamn-ttention to your incoming whispers (private messages), including audio overrides, notifications, and eye-popping chat box styling.

## Installation

From the Foundry VTT setup screen, go to "Add-on Modules", then "Install module", then in "Manfest URL", paste:

```
https://gitlab.com/n3dst4/louder-whispers/-/raw/main/module.json
```

And click "Install".


## Usage

None of the options are turned on by default. Go to "Configure Settings" => "Module Settings and turn on the options you want.

Would you like a feature to allow GMs to blast an airhorn at inattentive players, even when they have all the options turned off? Let me know!
